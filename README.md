Project Code of Developing-Data-Products by J.F.
================================================

This repository contains the code developed for the project of the Coursera course: Developing Data Products project of September 2014.

The application demonstrates some essential operations with the ui inputs which control the variance and mean of Gaussian distributions. Reactive output of operations running in the server file allow the rendering of the Gaussian distributions. These distributions were chosen due to their current relevance in Statistics and other fields.  

Instructions: The application is easy to use, the user only needs to select the mean and variance of each of the Gaussian distributions 1 (shown in black) and 2 (shown in blue). A check box is used to allow the user to display the non-normalized multiplication of the two Gaussian distributions displayed. The non-normalised multiplication is shown in red.

The files of this project are:
* server.R
* ui.R
