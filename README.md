Project Code of Developing-Data-Products by J.F.
================================================

This repository contains the code developed for the project of the Coursera course: Developing Data Products project of September 2014.

It demonstrates some essential operations with the ui inputs which control the variance and mean of Gaussian distributions. Reactive output of operations running in the server file allow the rendering of the Gaussian distributions. These distributions were chosen due to their current relevance in Statistics and other fields.  

The application is easy to use, as the user only needs to select the mean and variance of the Gaussian distributions. A check box is used to allow the user to display the non-normalized multiplication of the two Gaussian distributions displayed.

The files of this project are:
* server.R
* ui.R

This application is accesible in: http://neofranz.shinyapps.io/Project/

A presentation providing more details about this project is accessible via:

After a presentation of the application is disigned using slidify. The presentation was built with R Studio Presenter and can be visualized in the Rpubs hosting page:
