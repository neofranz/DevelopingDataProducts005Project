<h1>Documentation of Developing-Data-Products project</h1>

<p>The application demonstrates some essential operations with the ui inputs which control the variance and mean of Gaussian distributions. Reactive output of operations running in the server file allow the rendering of the Gaussian distributions. These distributions were chosen due to their current relevance in Statistics and other fields</p>

<h3>Instructions:</h3> 

<p>The application is easy to use, the user only needs to select the mean and variance of each of the Gaussian distributions 1 (shown in black) and 2 (shown in blue). The plots are continuously re-renderred due to the code in the server file. These values are modified through the respective slide controls in sidebar panel on the left of the application webpage.</p> 

<p>A check box at the bottom of the sidebar panel is used to allow the user to display the non-normalized multiplication of the two Gaussian distributions displayed. The non-normalised multiplication is shown in red in the plots area in the main panel on the right.</p>
